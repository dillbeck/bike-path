## Project Domain
Ridesharing is becoming more prominent in urban areas. There are supply and demand issues that can be identified so customers have less waiting time. Our group is curious to know how different features affect rental demand of transportation, specifically bicycles. 


## Dataset 
We further narrowed our topic to the Bike Sharing in Washington D.C. Dataset found on Kaggle.com. 
https://www.kaggle.com/marklvl/bike-sharing-dataset
This dataset provides a count of bikes rented in the Capital Bikeshare system, along with associated date/time, weather/conditions, and holiday data for a two-year period. 

## Analytic tool
- Data cleaning: excel, python, pandas, numpy
- Data visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
- Data analysis: sklearn

## Audience
- Capital Bikeshare System
- Local and state municipalities
 
## Application
- Build various prediction models for demand forecasting 
- Make it general enough that it can be used for other cities as well

## Limits and Improvements
- Try different models/approaches
- Use a larger dataset
- Check disparities among different regions
- More visualization
- In-depth data cleansing
