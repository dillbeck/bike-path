    "For our project, we would like our analyze transportation data in the United States. The transportation sector is immense, where data may be analyze by respect to the mode of transportation, geographic location, emissions, age or driver or rider, infrastructure (e.g. bike lanes, pedestrian sidewalks), ridesharing, safety, and more. Over the past several years and even decades, electric vehicles, ridesharing, and population migration patterns have impacted the transportation sector provide ample problems or trends waiting to be discovered. For instance, the social conscious to protect the quality of air and reduce national dependency of foreign oil has been cited as a boon to electric vehicle industry. Also, one could consider how population migration patterns have impacted the sale or ownership of vehicles to ridesharing. Lastly, one could also evaluate how are cities, regions or states are adjusting their transportation budgets in response to those changes to using alternate modes of transportation.  "

    "Our data analysis will potentially have different applications for different stakeholder groups.  Public interest groups or nonprofits may have an interest in our data on bike-share usage  to focus their efforts and further their mission, as well as engage supporters in the community.  Local and state municipalities may use our data to help with infrastructure planning, as well as citizen engagement and social responsibility. Existing businesses may use the data to support employee-engagement and work/life balance efforts, as well as from within their social responsibility platform.  Finally, entrepreneurs and start-up business may leverage the data to identify new markets or develop new-to-market products or concepts.\n",

    "## Application\n",
    "At present, the goal for our analysis will be to construct a prediction model for the Capital Bikeshare System in Washington, D.C.  As the analysis will take into consideration such things as bike usage, membership, weather, air quality, and holidays, the model created will potentially have application beyond the local environment of Washington, D.C. once these factors are adjusted for a new location.  The prediction model could support business decision, infrastructure planning, and community involvement, as well as present new opportunities for products or business concepts.\n",
